This is an application created in Android studio, for android devices.
Through this application we want to make public transport accessible, but we do not have enough knowledge for this.
The application involves a method of communicating with public transport and announcing the number of that transport.
It communicates through a bluetooth device mounted on the transport, and when the user on the phone presses a button, that bluetooth device will produce an audible signal to indicate to the blind person where the door of that means of transport is.
PS we are new to working with Git and we would greatly appreciate the help for the application as well as for the improvement of the github project page.
